                        <h2>Samosa Sweet Potatoes Wraps</h2><br>
                            <p>When we travel, we often make wraps to bring with us as a meal during our trip. They tend
                                to
                                be way more wholesome and delicious than the fast (and often expensive) options that are
                                available at the airport or train station.</p><br>
                            <p>Like most of our dishes, it's all about the toppings, and I think it's a must to have
                                some
                                sliced avocado, or at least a creamy dressing like our cashew lime or avocado garlic
                                cream.
                                I also like my wraps to be a bit more spicy with a little squirt of sriracha or a dollop
                                of
                                our Afghan Green Chutney.</p><br>
                            <p>These savoury wraps are easy to make and assemble the night before, just pop them in the
                                microwave the next morning, and you are good to go (adding the avocado after it's been
                                heated, preferably)! You can also make the fillings ahead of time and assemble the next
                                day.
                            </p><br>

                                These bars have a subtle sweetness and are rather filling thanks to the almond butter,
                                oats
                                and yogurt.

                            <p>First, stew the berries until soft, set aside to cool.</p>
                            <p>In a food processor, blend the dates until they are smooth, scraping down the sides as
                                needed. Add the oatmeal, ground flaxseed, almond butter, and cinnamon and combine,
                                scraping
                                down the sides once or twice.</p>
                            <p>Transfer the mix to a parchment lined baking dish and press the base into the dish. </p>
                            <p>Top with the yogurt and spread out evenly. </p>
                            <p>Dot the yogurt with the stewed berries and use a knife to swirl. </p>
                            <p>Place into the freezer and let freeze for 1-2 hours, or until the bars are solid enough
                                to
                                cut. </p>
                            <p>When removed from the freezer, cut into squares or bars of desired size. </p>
                            <p>Let thaw for 3-5 minutes before eating. Enjoy!

                            <p>This granola recipe is both sweet, because of the dates, raisins and dried cranberries,
                                as well as savoury, because of the tahini. You can vary it up each time depending on the
                                dried fruit or nuts and seeds you choose to add.</p><br>
                            <p>Let's walk through the step-by-step guide to make this yourself:</p><br>

                                <li>Step 2: create the date + tahini mixture by blending in a food processor</li>
                                <li>Step 3: roughly chop your raw nuts</li>
                                <li>Step 4: mix!</li>
                                <li>Step 5: transfer to oven-safe dish lined with parchment paper</li>
                                <li>Step 6: bake until golden and fragrant</li>
                                <li>Step 7: serve with plant-based yogurt and fresh fruit - make it look pretty!</li>
                            </ul><br>
                            <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li>1 cup (175 g) dates</li>
                                <li>1/2 cup (120 mL) tahini</li>

                                <li>1/2 cup (75 g) organic raisins</li>
                                <li>1/4 cup (30 g) dried cranberries</li>
                                <li>1/4 cup (35 g) raw sunflower seeds</li>
                                <li>1/4 cup (35 g) raw pumpkin seeds</li>

                            </ul><br>
                            <h3>Directions</h3>
                            <p>Preheat oven to 150 C / 300 F.</p>
                            <p>Mix dates, tahini and 3 Tbsp (45 mL) water in a food processor and blend until creamy.
                            </p>
                            <p>And all ingredients to a large bowl and mix to combine. </p>
                            <p>Spread granola evenly on baking paper and press flat. </p>
                            <p>Bake for 30 minutes, or until golden brown, stopping one or two times to stir and flatten
                                again if needed to prevent burning and to ensure the granola cooks evenly.</p>
                            <p>Let cool and transfer to an airtight container to store. Enjoy with smoothies,
                                plant-based yogurts or on its own as a snack.</p>
